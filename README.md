# Covid Colombia API

I created this simple api to show somethings i can do using python.
 This api was done using django-rest-framework and real cases of coronavirus in Colombia.
 The api is hosted in heroku, so if you wanna check the page you may need 30 secs aprox to the app to load, 
 this is according to heroku settings. Unfortunaly Heroku doesnt allow postgis on free accounts, the main idea was that the api
 was capable of process point and give some information of that point thats something i will correct in the future perphaps
 migrating to another PaaS
 
If you wanna play with the api this are some of the users and passwords.


user|password
----|--------
user_one|user_one_password
user_two|user_two_password
user_three|user_three_password
